Dahdi-linux-allstar-pi
======================

Package for Dahdi for Allstar...
Running "makepkg" as a non root user will create a Dahdi package for Arch Linux. 
This package contains the Allstar patch  (thanks to Jim Duuuude) to allow dahdi to work with Allstar. 
It works for Arch ARM on Raspberry PI model B....

It will download the dahdi source code if required...
After package install a reboot will be required.

Will update as needed.
